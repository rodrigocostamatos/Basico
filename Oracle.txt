Be sure to include a reference to System.Data.OracleClient.dll, and place the following at the top of your code along with all the other using statements:



// This really didn't need to be in its own method, but it makes it easier 
// to make changes if you want to try different things such as
// promting the user for credentials, etc.
static private string GetConnectionString() 
{ 
   // To avoid storing the connection string in your code, 
   // you can retrieve it from a configuration file. 
   return "Data Source=myserver.server.com;Persist Security Info=True;" + 
          "User ID=myUserID;Password=myPassword;Unicode=True"; 
}

// This will open the connection and query the database
static private void ConnectAndQuery() 
{ 
  string connectionString = GetConnectionString(); 
  using (OracleConnection connection = new OracleConnection()) 
  { 
    connection.ConnectionString = connectionString; 
    connection.Open(); 
    Console.WriteLine("State: {0}", connection.State); 
    Console.WriteLine("ConnectionString: {0}", 
                      connection.ConnectionString); 
    
    OracleCommand command = connection.CreateCommand(); 
    string sql = "SELECT * FROM MYTABLE"; 
    command.CommandText = sql; 
 
    OracleDataReader reader = command.ExecuteReader(); 
    while (reader.Read()) 
    { 
      string myField = (string)reader["MYFIELD"]; 
      Console.WriteLine(myField); 
    }
  }
}
